# MELODIA
Melodia is a web application that allows users to view their Spotify data
such as top artists and songs over varying periods of time as well as recently
played tracks. This information will be made available to the users in a clean user
interface that spans across pages that display artists, songs, and profile
information. We will also create playlists based on this user data obtained directly
from Spotify.
Our project will provide an amazing opportunity for the user to listen to
their favorite songs all over again and even discover new music similar to the
music they already love and listen to. Our projectâ€™s goal is to provide valuable
insight to users about their Spotify listening history and give them a way to
interact with this information.

To run it, use 'npm start' in the front-end and back-end directories. Secret key will be needed.
